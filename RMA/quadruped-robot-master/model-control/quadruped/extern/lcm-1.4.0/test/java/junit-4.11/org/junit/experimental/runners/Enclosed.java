/**
 * If you put tests in inner classes, Ant, for example, won't find them. By running the outer class
 * with Enclosed, the tests in the inner classes will be run. You might put tests in inner classes
 * to group them for convenience or to share constants.
 *
 * So, for example:
 * <pre>
 *  \@RunWith(Enclosed.class)
 *  public class ListTests {
 *      ...useful shared stuff...
 *      public static class OneKindOfListTest {...}
 *      public static class AnotherKind {...}
 *  }
 *  </pre>
 *
 * For a real example, @see org.junit.tests.manipulation.SortableTest.
